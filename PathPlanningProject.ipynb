        "In this project, a demonstration of a path planning algorithm is presented to help a vehicle navigate a busy highway as fast as possible within the speed limit of 50mph and as safe as possible without any collisions. There are 3 lanes on the highway and the path planning algorithm needs to choose an appropriate lane and speed for navigation. This demonstration is based on a simulator developed by Udacity and was completed as part of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. The [Udacity github repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project) for this project has all the details about the software used in the simulator and the installation instructions.\n",

Udacity has provided bash scripts to install this in both [Linux](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project/blob/master/install-ubuntu.sh)/[Mac](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project/blob/master/install-mac.sh) environments. These scripts are included in this repo.\n",
        "2. The simulator can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).\n",
        "3. To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following: `sudo chmod u+x term3_sim.x86_64`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Build Instructions (Linux/Mac)\n",
        "1. Clone this repo.\n",
        "2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`\n",
        "3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`\n",
        "4. Run it: `./path_planning`\n",
        "This should setup a listener for the code to get data from the simulator.\n",
        "5. Launch the simulator from a terminal: `./term3_sim.x86_64`.\n",
        "6. Select the Path Planning project and click start to start the simulation.\n",

        "The goal of this project is to develop a path planning algorithm to safely navigate a car around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving Â±10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. The car's localization and sensor fusion data will be provided along with a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car is supposed to maintain speeds as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible. The algorithm is to avoid collision with other cars and keep the car within the marked road lanes at all times, unless during lane change maneuvers. The final goal is for the car to complete one loop around the 6946m highway (~5 minutes at 50 MPH) with acceleration and jerk strictly less than over 10 ms^-2^ & 10 ms^-2^ respectively."

The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk (the rate of change of total acceleration). The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.\n"
